<p>In February of 2015, myself and several other local startups moved into Glasgow's newest co-working space, <a href="http://rookieoven.com/coworking/">RookieOven</a>.</p>

<p>Glasgow has a history steeped <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24820573">in shipbuilding</a>. At one point, the city was world-famous not for its battered Mars Bar but the shipbuilding industry, the heart of which was sited in Govan.</p>

<p>While the shipbuilding industry has long since declined, the famous Fairfield shipyard has been renovated into offices, which we now call home.</p>

<p>What was once the drawing office where shipping blueprints were devised is now a space for developers and designers to collaborate and bring ideas to life.</p>
