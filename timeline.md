<p><strong>July, 2005</strong><br />Inherit <a href="https://brokersdirect.co.uk">insurance business</a> from Dad. Spend years learning the ropes. Business coasts along.</p>

<p><strong>Q4, 2012</strong><br />Learn enough code to build a <a href="http://landlord-insurance.herokuapp.com/">scrappy prototype</a> of a quote system. Demo it to an insurer in London.</p>

<p><strong>August, 2014</strong><br />Software company introduces me to Mick, Director of an insurance company. Mick agrees to use his contacts to search for an insurer to partner with me on Jack.</p>

<p><strong>March, 2015</strong><br />Declined by an insurer I approach and hope to partner with.</p>

<p><strong>May, 2015</strong><br />Travel to London to pitch Jack to another insurer. They also decline.</p>

<p><strong>June, 2015</strong><br />Get admitted to hospital with chest pain and stress. Reconsider the trajectory of my career. Do I even want to be in insurance anymore?</p>

<p><strong>December, 2015</strong><br />Mick admits defeat. No insurer is willing to delegate authority to me. I feel like giving up.</p>

<p><strong>February, 2016</strong><br />Send desperate email to James from Worry+Peace. Introduce myself and ask for guidance.</p>

<p><strong>March, 2016</strong><br />Pass my first insurance exam. The following day I head to London to meet with James from Worry+Peace.</p>

<p><strong>May, 2016</strong><br />Get the green light from the FCA as an Appointed Representative. Join the Worry+Peace network. Rebrand Jack and start working on building a quote system and creating a policy.</p>
