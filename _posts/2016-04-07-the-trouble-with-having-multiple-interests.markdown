Creatives have a lot of ideas and interests, but it often leads to a lack of focus. If, like me, you want to build a business but have multiple interests, choosing just one to concentrate on is difficult. And downright scary.

What if you choose the wrong one? What if you change your mind? Can't you pursue them all?

I’ve always had multiple interests, but it’s meant I’ve been pulled in different directions and lacked focus. It's taken me a long time to admit that.

Here are some of my interests:

* Design
* Technology
* Insurance
* Photography
* Video games
* <strike>Mini Eggs</strike>

With my all-or-nothing approach, I struggle to just dip my toe in. I can’t simply play video games, _I have to start a blog about it_. And that's a problem.

For a while I tried juggling all of these. Wedding photography, two insurance companies. I had a gaming blog, weekly podcast and fortnightly slot on TV. I’d organise photography meet-ups, launched a photography course, and built a Ruby on Rails app.

This was troublesome for two reasons.

<h2>Reason One</h2>

I got burnt out. Juggling too much had left me drained, both mentally and physically. I was admitted to hospital with chest pain. _I’m in my 20’s!_

I felt such a fool when the doctors—who spend 12 hours a day on their feet saving lives—told me _I_ was stressed. The shame.

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Investing adequate time and energy into developing _one_ of your interests is challenging enough, but multiple of them? It simply isn’t sustainable over a long period of time. Your output of quality will suffer, as will your health.

<h2>Reason Two</h2>

Progress had plateaued. I couldn’t attract higher-end photography clients and charge more because I wasn’t doing it full-time. And my insurance business wasn’t growing because I was positioning myself as a photographer.

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Multiple interests lead to distraction, and being distracted means you'll only get so far. If growing a successful business is your aim (as it is mine), there will come a point you have to make a difficult decision. Businesses don’t blossom with 40% focus.

Let's be realistic. What can come from spreading yourself thin? A series of interests that have a fraction of your attention.

They’ll never make as much money as they could (if that's your intent), never be as of high quality as they should be, and never provide as much value to others as they could.

They'll fall short of fulfilling their—and your—potential.

Dabbling in all these interests isn't energy or time efficient, but I didn't want to completely stop doing them. The conclusion was to choose one to focus on turning into a business, and work elements of the others _into_ my business.

My goal is to build <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a>, but I'm doing so with design and technology (two of my interests) at the core. I'm no longer lured in different directions, and I get to incorporate elements of my interests into my primary focus—insurance.

_Nailed it._

Having multiple interests isn't neccesarily a bad thing. My problem was that my goal, which is to build a successful business, was at threat. Your goal may be different. That's for you to decide.

Now, if only I can figure out how to incorporate video games into insurance…
