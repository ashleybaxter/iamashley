Every month I'll be attempting a different, low cost marketing experiment. This month I tried buying ads. Dirty, filthy, paid ads. Not through the money sink that is Google Adwords, but via <a href="http://buysellads.com">BuySellAds</a> and Twitter ads for business. It works in my favour that both these networks have a strong presence in the design community, because that's a portion of the market I aim to zone in on (creative professionals).

<h3>Dirty, Filthy, Paid Ads</h3>

Ahh, my second month in business. Without the advantage of launch day traffic, I turned my attention towards BuySellAds. I was already familiar with BSA, using it to sell a small ad spot on my <a href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk">photography blog</a>. With web sites and Twitter accounts of varying size, price and in an abundance of industries, there's a lot of options for every budget. I targeted sites with a smaller following.

I focused on designers and freelancers, buying a recurring ad spot on a freelance site—which estimated 5,000 monthly impressions—and, as unethical as it felt, I paid for a sponsored tweet from a popular design blog.

Despite the recurring ad attracting over 1000 <em>impressions</em> thus far, a grand total of <strong>zero</strong> have clicked on my ad. Well, one has. Me. Just to test it was actually working.

I get it, business insurance is difficult to make enticing—even more so within a 125px block. I don't think I'd see much improvement on this ad with Don Draper writing the copy or dancing, singing insurance gorillas. I'll cancel it come the end of the month. 

Being a UK business, I had to ensure my sponsored tweet wasn't wasted on a largely US following. Using <a href="http://followerwonk.com/">Follower Wonk</a>, I researched what Twitter design accounts had authority in the UK. For $99 (£58), I paid for a tweet from an account with almost 140,000 followers.

I was aware that—despite a large number of followers—only a <em>tiny</em> fraction of them would click through. I wasn't expecting a stampede of 140,000 designers to my site. Further more, a tweet is said to only have a <a href="http://moz.com/blog/when-is-my-tweets-prime-of-life">lifespan of 18 minutes</a>. Fortunately, BSA provide a tool which analyses the most active times on Twitter for a selected account, so you can use this to your advantage.

At 4PM my paid tweet went live. Using <a href="http://www.olark.com/">Olark</a>, I watched the traffic pour in in real-time. It wasn't <em>overwhelming</em>, but—according to BSA—the tweet attracted <strong>561 clicks</strong>. Looking at my analytics, Twitter sent <strong>111 visitors</strong> to my site that day. Even if one of them converts, I should make my money back. This ad was a lot more engaging than the one on the freelance site, apparently, with <strong>5 retweets</strong> and <strong>15 favourites</strong>. Not bad for insurance!

<h3>The Holy Grail of Paid Advertising</h3>

I'd heard about Twitter ads in the past. First from <a href="http://writing.makeshift.io/pieces/how-i-got-a-click-through-rate-of-16-per-cent-on-twitter-ads">the Makeshift guys</a>, and then via a <a href="http://nickoneill.com/startup-marketing-podcast-casey-armstrong/">startup marketing podcast</a> I happened to listen to. Apparently it can yield some <em>very</em> effective results.

For me, this is the best discovery I could have made. <a href="http://www.wordstream.com/articles/most-expensive-keywords">Insurance is notoriously competitive in Google Adwords</a>, peaking at a CPC of £31. <em>Ouch</em>. Twitter ads is a similar set-up in the sense it utilises a bidding system, but the CPC is lower. A lot lower. The insurance bigwigs have yet to catch on, meaning I have little competition and can spend less than £1 for each impression. Hey, insurance bigwigs, let's agree on something—you can have Google Adwords, I'll have Twitter ads. Capiche?

I think Twitter ads may take a lot of experimenting and tweaking. I'm reaching a very targeted audience, though, and in control of what I spend. So far, my ad has reached <strong>3.14K</strong> people, but has only attracted an engagement rate of <strong>1.79%</strong>. I thought this was a horrifically poor percentage, but I received an encouraging email from Twitter telling me my ad is in the top 30% of all campaigns reaching my target audience. I've also had a few more quotes than normal trickle through the system, although it's hard to say it's as a result of the ads.

<h3>Were the dirty, filthy, paid ads worth it?</h3>

I'm happy to occasionally spend £100 on small experiments like this just to gauge the results. The paid tweet was pretty effective in terms of retweets and engagement, the only downside being visitors didn't stick around for long. I can work on this by tailoring my landing page to the specific ad.

The recurring ad on the freelance site was useless—let's just forget about that. Ultimately, I think I could see some success with Twitter ads, but I need to research and make some changes. I'm still finding, though, that 'free' marketing is the most effective (writing, speaking, podcasting etc), likely because it's more genuine.
