I met John in college. We were both studying music. Him a singer/songwriter, myself a drummer. If there was anyone on that course that would 'make it' in music, it was John. He had the whole package.

Handsome looks.

Fantastic voice.

Catchy songs.

Endless passion.

Our college days were 12 years ago. John's still performing music, but he's yet to sign that elusive record deal.

I bumped into him recently. He's working in a well-known boutique hotel, serving coffee in the hotel's event space. John isn't passionate about coffee, just like I'm not passionate about insurance.

Here's where it gets interesting. John understands it's _his_ responsibility to make his job enjoyable. To do that, he sprinkled elements of what he loves into his job. Music.

Taking advantage of having a space to host events, John began putting on gigs in the hotel. He called it 'Circuit Sessions', where he'd perform his own tracks alongside other musicians.

It's a win/win situation. John is getting to do what he loves on a regular basis, and the hotel benefits from people turning up and spending money at the bar.

Because the hotel is an international brand, John was able to take Circuit Sessions on a tour. Most recently, he showcased his music in New York City, performing in the hotel's Times Square location to promote his upcoming single.

John might not love serving coffee, but he loves what he's doing because he's made his job fun and relevant to his passion.

I work in insurance. It's safe to say I don't do what I love (who loves insurance?), but I love what I do. It's why I can relate to John's story.

Design and technology are two of my passions. Like John, I've sprinkled elements of what I love into my job. I'm building an <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">insurance company</a> with design and technology at its core. I don't love insurance, but I love my work because it's relevant to my passion.

The 'Do What You Love' message is everywhere. It's a <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/gary_vaynerchuk_do_what_you_love_no_excuses">TED talk</a>, a t-shirt, motivational poster or coffee coaster. While I think the advice to getting paid doing what you love means well, we're forgetting something important.

Your happiness doesn't hinge on doing what you love.

Whatever it is you're working on, it's your responsibilty to make it fun and relevant to your passion. You don't have to do what you love, but—with the same approach as coffee serving, music lovin' John—you can love what you do.
