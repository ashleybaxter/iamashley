<p>I didn&#8217;t intend to exchange <a href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk" title="Girl With A Camera">my photography</a> services for money. <em>It just started happening.</em> From modest beginnings, where I was slipped a £20 note at a gig I thought I had shot just for fun, to a steady stream of bookings from clients big and small, all of which I have landed without marketing myself as a professional photographer. This is how it happened.</p>

<h3>I consistently shared my work</h3>
<p>I got a blog. I updated it regularly. I didn&#8217;t wait until I felt good enough or skilled enough, I just shared my photos. My blog gained momentum, visitors returned, enquiries trickled in. It&#8217;s not rocket science—to get noticed, you <em>need</em> to put yourself out there. <strong>Share your work. And consistently.</strong></p>
<h3>I found a platform that works</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried many photo-sharing services—Flickr, Tumblr, 500px etc. Whilst some of my photos on Flickr have received 20,000+ views, not one has directly converted to a booking. What Flickr <em>is</em> great for, though, is selling individual photos to magazines and organisations. Facebook, on the other hand, regularly brings in enquiries and bookings for larger jobs—weddings! And I must not forget Twitter, which has been fundamental in helping me build rapport with people, leading to a number of direct bookings or recommendations to others. <strong>Find a platform that&#8217;s effective for the type of work you want to do, and <em>own</em> it.</strong></p>
<h3>I carried my camera everywhere</h3>
<p>I know a lot of photographers—both hobbyist and professional—who purposely leave their camera at home because <em>&#8220;it&#8217;s too heavy&#8221;</em>, or they <em>&#8220;can&#8217;t be bothered&#8221;</em>. The biggest client I&#8217;ve worked with hired me because of my portfolio of <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rockersdelight/sets/72157628070330537/" title="Street photography on Flickr">street photography</a>, which I had shot <em>just for fun</em>. I had never thought that simply exploring an interest in street photography would develop into anything other than a set of photos for my personal portfolio, yet it evolved into a very lucrative series of jobs. <strong>Stop waiting for an incentive to take pictures.</strong></p>
<h3>I love what I do</h3>
<p>There are <em>hundreds</em> of photographers local to me of a similar skill level. Even now, I&#8217;m victim to thinking, &#8220;Why me?&#8221; when lucky enough to receive a booking enquiry. But, as a friend recently <a href="https://twitter.com/cole007/status/464018791718858752">reminded me</a>, people hire you because they&#8217;re booking <em>you</em>. Your skill, price and location may be similar to other photographers, but <em>you&#8217;re</em> the unique factor. I often receive enquiries which open with, &#8220;We love how passionate you are about photography. It comes through in the photos you take&#8221;. <strong>People naturally want to work with those who love what they do.</strong></p>
<p>There&#8217;s no magic formula to building a business, accidental or not. To surmise; don&#8217;t get lazy, carry your camera everywhere, be passionate about your work, share your experiments and photos—and yes, it will take years, not weeks, to build a reputation and improve your skill, but if you enjoy what it is you&#8217;re doing, it will never feel like years.</p>
