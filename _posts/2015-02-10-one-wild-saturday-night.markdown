… I set up Goals in Google Analytics. I'm kicking myself for not doing it sooner. 

As I depend on a third-party platform to process insurance quotes for <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">my business</a>, I don't have access to a lot of critical data.

I can't see when users are abandoning the process, or how many people are completing the quote but _not_ taking out insurance, for example.

The best I can do is set up a Goal on Analytics and see how many people click on the quote CTA. It may not explicitly tell me if they've completed all of the steps, but it's a signal for how many quotes are being generated and where those users are coming from.

I can also make judgements based on the duration someone has spent on the quote system, which is a good indicator as to whether they complete or abandon the process. For example, I know that hit from Facebook was someone clicking the CTA out of curiosity because they only spent 20 seconds on it.

<h2>Where Are These People Coming From?</h2>

Until now, I've been in the dark as to what channel is converting best. Let's get specific (or 'transparent', in startup speak) and look at my numbers. I've only been measuring this for 12 days, so the data will undoubtedly change over time.

__12 days. 3362 hits. 38 quotes.__

That's a really bad conversion rate. I'll work on improving it, but at least I can now see what channels are performing best. I've listed them from highest converter to lowest.

* __Google:__ I didn't think my organic search placement was very high. Since Google list the majority of keywords in Analytics as 'not provided' (people logged into their Google account while browsing, I assume), it's impossible to know what people are searching for to come across my site.
* __Direct:__ This is probably me. Sometimes I sit with potential customers while they get a quote, using the direct URL to do that.
* __Twitter:__ A lot of my marketing efforts are focussed on distributing content via social media, so I'm glad to see Twitter is converting some of that traffic. I love you, Twitter.
* __Personal blog:__ Because much of my writing is about business, my personal blog has been good at driving traffic to the Insurance by Jack site.
* __Sponsorship:__ I've sponsored a few conferences. Industry Conf, Conf Conf, and Meat Conf. Conf overload. They display the Jack logo and link on their site.
* __Facebook:__ The level of engagement on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pages/Insurance-By-Jack/279246762228751?ref=hl">my business Facebook</a> page is very low, so this is a surprise. This is why it's important to track what data you can. It's unpredictable.
* __Instagram:__ The biggest surprise of them all! I've been experimenting with Instagram for my business lately. <a href="http://instagram.com/ashleybaxter">My personal account</a> has 40K+ followers. <a href="http://instagram.com/insurancebyjack">Insurance by Jack has 12</a>. I'm surprised anyone has followed through to get a quote.

Have you ever tried to build a business based on blind assumption? That's what I've been doing for the past 9 months. It's one of the pitfalls of depending on third-party platforms (there are also advantages, though). Now my blinkers are off, I have a lot more data to help me do things better.

So, just a small reminder: Set up those Google Analytic Goals sooner rather than later.
