<p>I was awarded &#8216;Most Likely To Be Famous&#8217; in my high school&#8217;s yearbook. Complete with fake Oscar-like trophy (seriously, I <em>must</em> dig out this yearbook), I remember awkwardly posing for the camera, the charming naïvety of my 16-year-old self unaware that touring the world as a drummer in the back of a filthy van <em>wouldn&#8217;t</em> be my future. My future, in fact, would be to <a href="http://brokersdirect.co.uk">sell insurance</a>.</p>
<p>If I had known the reality of not going on to fulfil my adolescent dreams, my teenage years would have been plagued by hopelessness, likely even depression.</p>
<p>In an all-too-common twist, I haven&#8217;t ended up where I thought I would. In fact, I&#8217;ve noticed that whenever I plan, life instead gifts me an unpredictable fate; one which always seems cruel at the time, but is usually a blessing.</p>

<p>I distinctly remember the embarrassment I associated with working in insurance. Growing up, I had been incredibly vocal about my passion for music and desire to pursue a career within the music industry, settling for any other outcome provoked feelings of failure – especially within an industry that bared zero resemblance to music. Ultimately, my job just didn&#8217;t &#8216;fit&#8217; my personality.</p>
<p>Or so I thought. As it happens – like most things – it simply required a shift in attitude.</p>
<p>I stopped looking at the insurance industry as boring, stuffy, corporate and uninspired. Instead I saw an opportunity. An opportunity to <em>not</em> be boring, stuffy, and uninspired and to otherwise do something different. I could <em>adapt</em> my job to fit my personality.</p>
<p>Life is what you make it (cliché alert!), and so I ensure I do activities on a daily basis I enjoy. My passion is the web, so I now build products for my business with a focus on good design and simple technology. &#8220;Good design&#8221; and &#8220;simple technology&#8221; isn&#8217;t typically associated with insurance, and so this gives me a sense of worth in regards to my work (being different, not following the pack). The bigger picture is building a business with design at its core, something I don&#8217;t see other insurers doing, yet something <em>I&#8217;m</em> passionate about.</p>
<p>With this simple shift in attitude, I now see the insurance industry as a golden opportunity, albeit its many, many flaws. In fact, I&#8217;m cooking up something special that, surprisingly, may benefit you.
