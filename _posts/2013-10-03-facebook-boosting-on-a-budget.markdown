<p>Out of curiosity, I &#8216;boosted&#8217; a couple of posts on <a title="Girl With A Camera on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/girlwithacamerauk">my photography Facebook page</a> yesterday. As this was simply an experiment as opposed to a means of gaining any real traction, I selected the bare minimum from the drop-down menu (before realising you can specify your own budget), which – without explanation – differed between both my chosen posts.</p>
<p>My photography page has been hovering around 900+ &#8216;likes&#8217; for some time, and I really only pick up a new &#8216;like&#8217; every other day. I&#8217;m happy with the level of interaction on my page, averaging about 300-400 views with each update, but it would be great to reach a wider crowd and tap into my audiences&#8217; network of friends.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The first post I boosted was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=513725538718010&amp;l=c994f1494c">an individual photo</a> I&#8217;d uploaded to a Facebook album. I paid £3 to potentially reach a further 1900 &#8211; 3600 people (estimation), targeting my audiences&#8217; friends. It seemed a good bargain, and despite falling short in its estimation and &#8216;only&#8217; reaching 1307 people, it still felt worth the £3 investment.</p>
<p>Out of those <strong>1307</strong> people, <strong>47</strong> clicked on the photo and <strong>6</strong> &#8216;liked&#8217; my page. Prior to paying Facebook to boost my photo, it had just over 300 views. I was happy with these figures, especially my new page &#8216;likes&#8217;.</p>
<p>I decided to boost a different breed of post, one that linked to my blog, showcasing multiple photos of a recent wedding I had shot. I thought this would be more successful in engaging users as there were a number of different photos, and peeking into someone else&#8217;s wedding day is interesting. I  was a lot more specific with my targeting this time, choosing to reach women aged between 24 and 31 in the UK. The minimum budget of this was £9,  a bit pricier than the individual photo… yet I&#8217;m not sure why.</p>
<p>The paid reach of this link was <strong>4868</strong> people, which is significantly higher than the individual photo I had boosted. Despite that, the interaction felt poorer.</p>
<p><strong>98</strong> people viewed the post on my Facebook page (more than double the post views my other experiment had returned), with <strong>67</strong> people clicking through to the link and bringing them to my blog. <strong>9</strong> people &#8216;liked&#8217; the post. No new page &#8216;likes&#8217;, though, which is ultimately what I was hoping for.</p>
<p>It seems photos posted directly to Facebook perform better engagement-wise than those linking to external sites. Once people click the external link, opening a new window or tab, they may get distracted and fail to navigate back to the Facebook page, producing less chance of a &#8216;like&#8217;.</p>
<p>Given how affordable (and addictive) it is to boost a post, I&#8217;ll definitely be trying this method again, especially in regards to promoting my wedding work. However, instead of boosting a post that links to my blog, I&#8217;ll be uploading the wedding photos to a Facebook album instead. I must remind myself, though, that £10 to boost a new post won&#8217;t break the bank, but doing so for every update quickly adds up.</p>
<p>So, yes, after my boosting spree my Facebook page is sitting at 948 &#8216;likes&#8217;. Round it up to 950 by <a title="Girl With a Camera on Facebook" href="https://www.facebook.com/girlwithacamerauk">giving me a &#8216;like&#8217;</a>, will you?</p>
