Last week I gave my talk, Idea to Execution and Beyond, at <a href="https://2017.webdevconf.com/">Web Dev Conf</a> in Bristol.

_Side note: Web Dev Conf is one of the friendliest and funniest conferences I've attended. It's an annual event, so make sure you attend next year._

This was the first time I've delivered this talk. My aim was to give a high-level view of building and launching something, drawing from my experience of building <a href="https://withjack.co.uk">With Jack</a>.

I covered the idea stage, build process, what to expect when you launch and what happens after you launch. Specifically, I spoke about topics such as idea validation, embracing transparency, shipping anxiety and customer development.
