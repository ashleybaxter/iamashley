My business, <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a>, has survived a whole quarter. Not exactly worthy of a feature on <a href="https://thedistance.com/">The Distance</a>, but I'm working on it. Whilst it certainly hasn't made me rich, I have recouped over 50% of what I've invested into the business.

The insurance game was always going to be a slow burner for me, and that's OK. It took my Dad (who was much smarter than me) 2 years to build his insurance business to a comfortably profitable stage. I remember—as a young teenager—being pulled aside in his office where he said, "I'm finally making good money, Ashley. If you ever need a tenner to go and see your pals, just ask". That was a nice moment.

Similar to <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/a-look-at-my-first-month-in-business-on-a-budget/">my first month in business</a>, I figured it'd be fun to assess its quarterly performance and what's worked, as well as what hasn't.

I've bypassed any details about social media and direct traffic as, similar to my first report, it still accounts for the biggest source of traffic (53% and 21%, respectively).

Podcasting: <a href="http://workingoutpodcast.com">Working Out</a> has been a weekly show I co-host about building a passion-based business. I'm also a regular guest on <a href="http://unfinishedbusiness.bz">Unfinished Business</a>. Despite only accounting for <strong>7.48%</strong> of Jack's traffic, podcast listeners have been a strong converter to customers—likely because it enables me to give a voice to my insurance company, making what is typically seen as a faceless corporation more personable and relatable. I regularly receive emails from people looking for insurance, referring to the podcast and stating they can relate to a topic we've discussed. Seriously, I can't stress how effective podcasting has been for putting my message out there and giving my business a human element. If you're flirting with the idea of trying it, I wrote a recent post on <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/business-and-marketing/2014/08/26/boost-your-business-with-podcasting.html">podcasting for businesses</a>.

Sponsored tweets: I blogged about my brief flirtation with <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/99-dollars-for-a-sponsored-tweet-how-did-it-perform/">sponsored tweets</a> in June. I had high hopes for this model as a lot of my target audience hang out on Twitter, but Twitter prevented me from paying for tweets because of the industry I'm in (finance). I'm now trying an indirect method of advertising my business via sponsored tweets, promoting <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/why-do-i-need-business-insurance">my business insurance guide</a> instead of directly advertising our products. Cheeky? Maybe, but the little guy's got to get cheeky.

Paid ads: Buying ad space on other blogs or websites is where I've seen the least amount of success, accounting for just over <strong>1%</strong> of my traffic. In fact, if there's one thing I've learned in the past few months, it's that the less I spend on marketing, the more engagement I experience.

Personal blog: Blogging on this very site—as infrequent as it is—has seen a decent drive in traffic, responsible for <strong>8.74%</strong> of visitors. Sharing what you're learning through blogging is becoming increasingly popular, with companies like <a href="http://www.groovehq.com/blog">Groove</a> depending on it to increase awareness to their product.

SEO: I guess I suck at SEO because I'm not ranking particularly high for any keywords that aren't relating directly to my brand. I thought—now that the site is four months along—I'd be ranked for some long-tail keywords through the content I've been publishing on <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/blog">the blog</a>, but that hasn't happened. As it stands, search traffic accounts for <strong>7.63%</strong> of hits, the bulk of which is people searching directly for 'Insurance by Jack'.

SlideShare: Reproducing content and sharing via SlideShare was suggested to me in the <a href="http://www.growthhackinghandbook.com/">Growth Hacking Handbook</a> I've been reading. I called my presentation <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/insurancebyjack">"I'm a freelancer. Why business insurance?"</a>. It was a half hour of work that generated 800+ views. Judging from the spike in sales, it addressed the right questions and converted well. Not many people are going to read a presentation on business insurance unless they're considering purchasing it. Redistributing content in multiple formats is something I'll be trying again.

Giveaways: When my passport didn't turn up on time, I ran <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/hybridconf/">a giveaway for a ticket</a> I had bought to a conference in Sweden. It briefly hit the front page of Hacker News (briefly!) and sent what accounts for <strong>2.2%</strong> of my traffic. After that, I read a post from Noah Kagan about using giveaways to grow your business. I can't find it online as it was published via his newsletter, but here's a <a href="http://www.appsumo.com/giveaways-early-special/">similar article</a>. I think this is especially helpful for capturing email addresses, and it's something I'll experiment with in the future.

Public speaking: I find it tricky to measure the effectiveness of public speaking as it translates to direct traffic (or Google searches), but I certainly experience a spike in hits and enquiries. I think public speaking is similar to podcasting, in the sense you get to provide a human element to a business. However, I want to spend this year working on my business, making mistakes and hopefully experiencing triumphs, then I'll get back into public speaking next year with new content.
