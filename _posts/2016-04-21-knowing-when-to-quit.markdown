Seth Godin's <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Dip-extraordinary-benefits-knowing-stick/dp/0749928301/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1461228064&sr=8-1&keywords=the+dip">The Dip</a> is a tiny book. It's 96 pages short, yet it helped me arrive at an important life decision.

Call it serendipity, but I came across The Dip at the perfect time.

I was waking up without any excitement towards <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">my insurance business</a>. I was juggling photography alongside it—which was steadily growing—and knew I'd reached a point where I had to focus on just one. The <strike>easy</strike> obvious choice was photography.

Insurance is challenging. The start up costs aren't small and getting authorised requires jumping through hoops. There are a lot of barriers to entry into the industry, yet the reward can be high. 

Photography was flourishing, but it's a business that's difficult to scale. I can't shoot 365 weddings a year. The business is limited to my physically being there.

The impact I could have with insurance felt bigger, but the pace at which I was progressing was painfully slow. Add to that my dwindling enthusiasm and I was considering throwing in the towel to focus on photography (or something else) full-time.

This was due to a series of knock-backs and leads that never panned out. Every time I thought I was getting somewhere, a period of stagnation would follow and ultimately land me back in the position I started.

Enduring years of 'close but no cigar' will take its toll, and after a lot of rejection my mindset shifted from _this is challenging_ to _this is impossible_.

Then I read The Dip.

The Dip talks about that all-too-familiar phase of a project. The part where excitement fades and _"…it gets harder and less fun, until it hits a low point - really hard, really not fun"_.

That part is known as The Dip. I identified as being there with insurance. Apparently it gets better if you keep pushing—but few people do.

Insurance isn't impossible to break into, but my unconventional route into the industry meant I lacked the contacts and knowledge of its inner workings. If I wanted to push through The Dip, insurance had to have my _full_ commitment.

Godin says the system expects you to give up, but if you persevere through The Dip you'll have a chance at achieving extraordinary results. You can quit or be exceptional. Those are your options.

There are some things I don't want to be exceptional at. I've quit a bunch of side projects since reading The Dip, all in a bid to focus on insurance. Podcasting, photography meet-ups, side projects. Successful people quit the _right_ things.

How do I know I've made the correct decision in pushing harder with insurance rather than quitting? I don't, but Seth Godin taught me that if it's worth doing, there's probably a dip.
