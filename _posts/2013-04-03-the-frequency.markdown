<p>Yesterday I was lucky enough to be invited onto <a title="The Frequency" href="http://5by5.tv/frequency">The Frequency</a> with <a title="Dan Benjamin" href="http://twitter.com/danbenjamin">Dan</a> and <a title="Haddie Cooke" href="http://twitter.com/haddiebird">Haddie</a>, one of <a title="5by5.tv" href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a>&#8216;s excellent shows. I had never done any podcasting before, but after a few minutes I had forgotten it was a <em>live</em> show and felt I was chatting to two friends about video games. Oh, and the Loch Ness Monster. If you missed it, fret not, <a title="The Frequency" href="http://5by5.tv/frequency/115">you can still listen to the episode here</a> and cringe at my Scottish accent.</p>
