<p>The anniversary of my father&#8217;s death (21/07) should be a grim day, and I admit I could easily allow it to descend into that if I think not of the opportunities that have arisen as a result of his passing, but what I am missing by not having my old man here.</p>
<p>If my dad were alive, I wouldn&#8217;t…</p>

<ul>
<li>have <a title="Girl With A Camera" href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk">picked up a camera</a>, which has evolved into a healthy second income for myself, taking me to new places and encouraging me to meet new faces. My camera is a constant source of joy, it&#8217;s mad to think of a life without it.</li>
<li>grasp the significance of keeping fit. I watched firsthand the effect of a lifelong smoking habit and unhealthy diet, which gave me an understanding of what it means to stick around for family. I&#8217;d likely not have joined the gym, which has developed into a passion for lifting weights, being strong and generally breaking into a daily sweat.</li>
<li>have the work ethic I do, because there would be the comfort of knowing I could fallback on my dad for financial support.</li>
<li>have took to the stage at <a title="Industry Conference" href="http://2013.industryconf.com/">Industry Conference</a>. A terrifying experience that helped me to &#8216;level up&#8217; in life.</li>
<li>have developed a crippling anxiety disorder, which – at its worst – meant I refused to leave the house. By facing my fear, though, and breaking free from its clutches, I&#8217;ve learned more about strength than any back squatting in the gym has taught me.</li>
<li>have learned to program and built <a title="Lodger" href="http://lodgerapp.com">my first app</a>. Learning to program was a lesson in commitment and perseverance. Whether it pays off or not financially is mostly irrelevant, what matters is I&#8217;ve discovered a new hobby  – a hobby which is very empowering.</li>
<li>be in the insurance industry. Okay, that&#8217;s nothing to write home about, but I believe I&#8217;ve been given an opportunity to disrupt a very traditional and tech-backwards industry.</li>
</ul>
<p>They say every cloud has a silver lining, but that silver lining is entirely dependant on <em>your</em> attitude and what you choose to take from a situation.</p>
