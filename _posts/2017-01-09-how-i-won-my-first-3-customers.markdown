When I launched Insurance by Jack in 2014, I struggled to win sales.

One week passed… nothing. Week two… zilch. 

It took me three weeks to make my first sale. It was a slither of momentum, but it wasn't the start of my business gaining steam. 

I knew why I was struggling. Insurance by Jack had a strong brand, but the process of getting a quote involved a third-party form. This resulted in a customer journey that wasn't cohesive and made for a poor user experience.

Fast forward two years, Insurance by Jack has evolved into <a href="https://withjack.co.uk">Jack</a> and I've been granted more permission and responsibility. Now that I've taken control of the design and technology, I've created a customer journey that compliments Jack's brand.

The theory that this would improve sales was true. So much so, I made my first sale three weeks _before_ I launched. A stark contrast to 2014's launch to crickets.

Last week I celebrated putting my 50th freelancer on cover, but I want to start at the beginning and share how I won my first _three_ customers.

<h2>My First Customer</h2>

In the run up to launch, I replaced Insurance by Jack's website with a landing page. I wrote a couple of paragraphs on my vision for insurance, which I followed with a call to action to be notified of launch.

120+ people opted in. This surprised me because it’s _insurance_. Having 10 people pay attention would have been a success.

I sent 3 emails to this list.

__1. Coming soon: The new Jack.__ I touched upon my journey in insurance and detailed what people can expect from the new Jack.

__2. Want to test the new Jack?__ A short email asking for beta testers. 29 people responded.

__3. Introducing the new Jack.__ The soft launch email. I announced I was open for business.

Designers and developers love collaborating. They enjoy seeing other people’s work and offering solutions as to how they’d approach it differently.

Email number 2—where I asked people to test the quote form—was the ideal way to open dialogue with my target audience. Not only did I get constructive feedback on the process, but several people actually wanted to buy insurance.

This is how I won my first customer _before_ I launched.

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Involve your target audience in the build process. At the very least be transparent about what you're working on—people will take an interest and want to support you. 

<h2>My Second Customer</h2>

I quietly pushed Jack live from a hotel room in Berlin with terrible WIFI.

When I say _quietly_, I didn't announce the service was available. I deployed it to GitHub Pages, walked away and played tourist in Berlin.

The following day I checked <a href="/2016/09/13/tools-i-use/">my CRM tool</a> and was surprised to see a quote had come through. It was from a name I recognised.

This person had been following me <a href="http://twitter.com/iamashley">on Twitter</a> for years. Our first exchange was 5 years ago—back in 2012! This was two years before I had even started my crusade into business insurance.

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Marketing is about <a href="https://justinjackson.ca/play-the-long-game/">the long game</a>. Relationships established years ago can blossom into paying customers.

<h2>My Third Customer</h2>

By this point I still hadn’t announced I’d launched Jack. I was aiming to do a few weeks in soft launch, so I was expecting any quotes that came through to be from beta testers.

During this time I gave <a href="/idea-to-launch-in-11-years/">a talk at Hybrid</a>, a conference for creatives.

With the first iteration of Jack (Insurance by Jack), I had no control over the customer journey. I had no idea who my customers were or where they were coming from. It made tracking marketing very difficult. Especially public speaking.

As a quote had come through from someone that _wasn't_ a beta tester, I asked where they'd heard of Jack.

<blockquote>We heard about Jack through friends that'd been chilling at Hybrid. We looked at your site and we're suckers for a good design. Truth be told we'd never thought about insurance, but the site was fun, friendly and didn't feel like chewing glass.</blockquote>

What do you know, public speaking _can_ convert. Thanks to the <a href="https://hybridconf.net/">HybridConf</a> attendee who passed along Jack's name.

<strong>Lesson:</strong> Share your story everywhere. All it takes is for one person to hear it and share it with their friend.

<h2>tl;dr</h2>

I won my first three customers through the following channels:

* Beta tester
* Twitter
* Public speaking

I'm having a lot of fun building Jack and finding ways to win customers, but I do need a better formula.

I'm heading to Switzerland for my birthday in a few weeks for a (working) holiday. One of the books I plan on reading is <a href="http://tractionbook.com/">Traction</a>. I'm hoping to use their three-step framework to discover the best channels for marketing Jack.

Hopefully one day I'll be writing about winning my 3000th customer, but I'm <a href="/newsletter">documenting my journey</a> of building an insurance business from the start.
