It's buzzword central in the insurance industry at the moment. There's a lot of rumbling about 'disruption', innovation and moving things in a digital direction.

I'm enjoying the attention tech is finally getting, and I'm excited the industry is <a href="http://www.digitalinsurancecollective.co.uk/static/so-its-clear-we-are-going-to-be-disrupted-at-some-point">recognising it's at risk</a> if it doesn't invest in digital infrastructure. It's even better to see people <a href="http://thedigitalinsurer.co.uk/">doing something about it</a>.

But I think we're getting a bit carried away.

73% of people don't trust their insurance provider. That's an astounding number! Fancy technology won't fix that.

What will fix it? __Getting the simple things right.__

Customers value transparency, yet the insurance industry is lacking in its openness. Confusing terminology puts barriers between consumer and insurer. Nobody is ever really sure what they're covered for, or if their insurer will step up in times of need.

People have been trained to expect a bad experience with their insurer. Improving the experience by _just_ 10% would make a huge difference.

Technology is a small part of improving the experience. Insurers should be speaking to their customers. No, wait, _listening_ to their customers. 

Digital tools and a mobile first approach is important, but without getting the simple things right, there's still the striking fact that the majority of people don't trust their provider.

I don't think the business model needs rewritten, and chasing innovation where technology is concerned is futile if the fundamentals aren't right. I suggest insurers go back to the drawing board.

Don't make assumptions, _speak_ to customers. Find ways to be more open. Use simpler language when talking about insurance. Surprise and delight customers.

Let's aim for >73% of people being _happy_ with their provider, aware of what they're paying for, and confident their insurer will do the job they've been paid to do.

_Then_ we can think about 'disrupting' insurance via technology.
