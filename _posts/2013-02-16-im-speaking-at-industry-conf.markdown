<p>In a little over 2 months, I will be delivering my first public talk at <a title="Industry Conf" href="http://industryconf.com/">Industry</a> – a conference for web industry professionals in Newcastle.</p>
<p>I detailed my background of how I got to be involved with my business in <a title="Interview with Ashley Baxter" href="http://blog.industryconf.com/interview-with-ashley-baxter/">an interview with Gavin</a>, so attendees can expect my talk to elaborate on that. Mostly, though, I want to focus on how painfully backwards the insurance industry is in regards to technology, and how I&#8217;m working towards improving that. Factor in the mistakes I&#8217;ve made, lessons learned, and I&#8217;m hoping to divulge a deeply personal talk.</p>
