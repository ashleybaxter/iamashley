This started out as a very different post. I was planning on sharing my insurance business roadmap—what explicit steps are needed to make <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/business/2016/01/07/the-business-i-want-to-build/">my vision</a> a reality.

The truth is, for a long time I've struggled with understanding what the next step is.

There's a lack of practical information from people who've done this already. They don't share the obstacles they faced or lessons learned. We see this candidness in other industries, but not insurance.

I can learn how to start a <a href="https://www.shopify.co.uk/guides/dropshipping">dropshipping business</a>, build a <a href="https://creativeclass.io/">better freelance career</a> or become a <a href="http://irresistiblepodcasting.com/">professional podcaster</a>. But the business of insurance isn't as transparent.

The barrier to entry into the industry is high. This is especially true for those coming into it from an unconventional background, like myself.

I've spent a lot of time lost on the regulatory website, which aims to provide guidance for those seeking entry into insurance, but is complicated to navigate and boasts 80+ broken links. (I ran it through <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/integrity/id513610341?mt=12">Integrity</a>.)

My insurance business roadmap, in other words, was full of holes and guesswork.

<h2>Asking For Help</h2>

For the past 6 months I've devoured everything I can on the subject of insurance and tech. I've discovered a world where people are passionate about technology _and_ work in insurance.

It's dubbed 'Insurtech'. It even has <a href="http://www.startupbootcamp.org/accelerator/insurance-london.html">its own Accelerator</a>.

It was at 3AM one sleepless night I reached out to someone in this group and asked for direction. Specifically for "…guidance on insurance brokerage authorisation" because I hadn't had success navigating the regulatory body's website.

Authorisation grants me a lot more control over important things like the customer journey, which is exactly what I want.

With years of false starts, rejection and setbacks, I wasn't expecting this to be a defining moment in my journey. I just wanted an honest chat with a human. Someone who, at one point, had been in my shoes.

That small task of asking for help has taken me in a different direction with <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/">Jack</a>. I don't mean _away_ from insurance. I mean closer. A new partner, more creative control. Most importantly, clarity on what my roadmap should look like.

Things are finally moving in the right direction. All because I asked for help.

<h2>The Power of Naive Questions</h2>

Last week I attended a meetup in Glasgow called <a href="http://www.thisisjamhot.com/gab/">Gab</a>. It reinforced the idea of _asking_ for things, whether it be guidance or opportunity.

The speaker at this meetup accounted his writing success down to 'naivety'. He would contact his favourite magazines and ask to write for them. They would give him a job. He even contacted his favourite record label and asked for a contract. As a result, his band released two albums on the same label as Oasis.

Whilst I've been vague about what this new direction is (I'll share more soon), I have learned a valuable lesson. Asking for help, opportunity or direction doesn't imply weakness.

Where would my business be had I reached out 6 months ago? It would be a lot further along. It would be in a much _stronger_ position.

Asking is sometimes the best thing you can do.
