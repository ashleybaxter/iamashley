When my Dad first founded <a href="https://brokersdirect.co.uk">the business</a> I'd later inherit, SEO was very much a 'thing'. It was the late 90's—you could build an entire business around keyword optimisation.

Many people did. My Dad was one of them. He became an expert at Search Engine Optimisation, dominating his niche on Google.

Of the 10 first-page results for our chosen keywords, his websites would account for 5+ of those. This was how he bootstrapped his business—run from the hallway in our house—to be worth over £1 million.

In 2005 I inherited the business. My story _doesn't_ resemble Gary Vaynerchuk's, where he <a href="http://fortune.com/2014/12/08/is-gary-vaynerchuk-vaynermedia-for-real/">grew his family wine business</a> from $3 million in annual revenue to $50 million.

There are many reasons why. One of them was the foolishness of being dependent on someone else's platform (Google) to generate leads.

This is small business suicide. Platforms change all the time—some of them even disappear altogether. If it's not your own platform, you have no control over that happening.

If your livelihood is banking on that platform continuing to operate in the way it has been, you're playing a risky game. Nothing on the internet stays the same forever.

A couple of significant changes happened in 2005, just as my Dad passed away and I inherited the business.

1. Comparison websites burst onto the scene and changed the way people shop for insurance. Fewer people used Google to find cover. Instead they flocked to aggregator sites for a list of insurers based on who was the cheapest. This impacted the industry negatively. For insurers, it became about cost competing. This drove the price of premiums down, leaving little (if any) profit. Consumers made decisions based on price instead of level of cover or service.

2. Google overhauled their ranking algorithm. Gone was the emphasis on keywords—now it was about content and social factors, of which we had invested no time into. Our rankings dropped significantly. We were now invisible on the one channel that sustained us.

Even if we focused on improving our rankings, the buying behaviour of consumers shopping for insurance had changed. Since we'd recklessly put all our eggs in Google's basket, the business was at risk.

This was over a decade ago. Our customer acquisition has diversified, but we're still more vulnerable than I'd like to be.

Even now, my business relies on third-parties. I sell someone else's product (insurance policy), use someone else's platform (quote system), and market on someone else's service (Twitter, Facebook etc.).

I don't control any of the experience.

To reduce my platform dependency and have better control over my business, I'm working towards:

* Growing an email list
* Selling a policy I had influence in creating
* Building my own system to distribute it through

The consequences of putting your trust in other platforms can be huge.

<a href="http://arstechnica.com/business/2013/09/how-zynga-went-from-social-gaming-powerhouse-to-has-been/">A famous example is Zynga</a>, whose entire business model was built around publishing games on Facebook. Facebook changed its policies and Zynga's traffic fell substantially.

Facebook wanted to limit Zynga's activity… and they _could_, because Zynga had built its game on the Facebook platform.

Just recently, one of the insurers I was an affiliate for ceased their partner program entirely. This is why I'd discourage people from hosting their blog on <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, or centering their marketing strategy around <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>, or building a business selling another company's product.

When you build your business on top of someone else’s platform, rather than building your own, you're giving up control.

If the conditions change or the platform disappears altogether, you're screwed. Using third-party platforms may be the quickest way to getting started, but it's also the quickest way to go out of business.
