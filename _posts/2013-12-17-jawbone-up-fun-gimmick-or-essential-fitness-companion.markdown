<p>I don&#8217;t wear jewellery. It&#8217;s something I never think to spend money on, unless it can track my sleep, diet and movement. I&#8217;m referring to the <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/?_encoding=UTF8&#038;camp=1634&#038;creative=19450&#038;field-keywords=jawbone%20up&#038;linkCode=ur2&#038;sprefix=jawbone%2Caps%2C202&#038;tag=rockedelig-21&#038;url=search-alias%3Daps" title="Jawbone Up">Jawbone Up</a>, of course, which I&#8217;ve consistently worn for six months. Day. And. Night. Throughout the six months, my relationship with Up has meandered from fun gimmick and downright frustrating, to essential fitness companion.</p>
<p><em>Know yourself. Live better. Wake up feeling refreshed.</em></p>

<h3>Essential Fitness Companion</h3>
<p>Japan popularised the notion of walking 10,000 steps a day, but when I reflect on particular periods of my life, I&#8217;d be surprised if I was totalling 2000. A sedentary lifestyle of working from home, coupled with an obsession for video games. Gross. Of course, I didn&#8217;t realise this at the time. Ignorance is bliss, and it wasn&#8217;t until I began wearing the Jawbone Up and tracking my movement, the realism of how little I have moved in the past became apparent.</p>
<p>To put it into perspective, even jogging to my gym prior to carrying out an intense workout doesn&#8217;t mean I hit my daily goal. To hit my target, I also have to walk 2 miles to work.</p>
<p>In that respect, the Jawbone Up does what I bought it to do – encourages me to move.</p>
<h3>Downright Frustration</h3>
<p>Of course, with this type of device it hasn&#8217;t been without technical glitches. After 6 months, I am now on my third Up; the first refusing to sync, the second devoid of any vibration functionality (which is important. And get your mind out of the gutter). With that said, even if it isn&#8217;t third time lucky for me, replacing the band has been hassle-free.</p>
<h3>Fun Gimmick</h3>
<p>Such a gadget can become a gimmick, with most people having 9-5 routines, or regular routes they walk. This means it can only take a month or so to familiarise yourself with the numbers. For example, I know my walk to and from work, which I do most days, will net just under 6000 steps. I know my 3 mile run nets almost 5000 steps.</p>
<p>In fact, out of the 6 Team members I have (in other words, friends with a Jawbone Up), I think I am the only person consistently wearing the band.</p>
<h3>Eat Clean, Train Hard</h3>
<p>I&#8217;ve just returned a Fitbit Flex I bought for my mother&#8217;s Christmas, opting to replace it with a Jawbone Up instead (it&#8217;s okay, I don&#8217;t think my mother reads my blog). Why? The Fitbit doesn&#8217;t boast as extensive a food library as the Up, nor the ability to scan barcodes. This has become a surprising asset for me.</p>
<p>After giving up on food diary apps in the past, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d find enough of an incentive to log my meals (when I remember), but having a food diary alongside my workout means I can accurately see how many calories I&#8217;ve consumed, and how many I&#8217;ve burned. This has been a perfect feature for somebody like myself, looking to tighten up my diet.</p>
<h3>Sleep Is Boring</h3>
<p>The sleep portion of the Up, whilst interesting at times, is my least used feature. I&#8217;ve noticed the less sleep I get, the less I&#8217;ll move the next day, but it&#8217;s hardly rocket science as to why that is. I usually only log 2 or 3 night&#8217;s sleep a week, forgetting to monitor the rest. Perhaps this would be a useful feature for some, but my sleep is fairly regular, therefore not particularly interesting. I do, however, like the smart alarm I&#8217;ve set for the morning, gently awaking me at the best time based on my body’s natural sleep cycle.</p>
<p>£100 for such a gadget is a fair bit of money, but I&#8217;m glad I purchased an Up and have stuck to using it solidly for 6 months. I do believe I&#8217;ve done a lot more moving as a result of wearing it. If it&#8217;s 9PM and I&#8217;m stagnating around the 9000 step mark, I&#8217;ll take the dog out a walk to hit my target. Every little helps, and the dog is happier.</p>
<p>I do see why it&#8217;s easy for the Up to fall into the novelty trap, but it&#8217;s a daily incentive for me to move and eat well. I&#8217;m not saying I always <em>do</em> move and eat well, but the Up is a gentle reminder to do so.</p>
