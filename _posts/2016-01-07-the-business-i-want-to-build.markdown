<a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a> in its current model is my MVP. The embarrassing thing is, though, that it's been in a minimally viable state for too long.

<a href="https://storify.com/insurancebyjack/insurance-by-jack-launch-at-dot-york">I launched Insurance by Jack in May of 2014</a>. The business I had inherited from my Dad had steadily declined over the years and I needed a plan B.

There are various factors that contributed to this, which I'll write about another time. It's interesting dissecting where it went wrong (and how to avoid it this time). A big factor, however, was this:

I didn't build an audience in an industry I was familiar with and promote a product to them. Nor did I uncover a passion and build a business around something I was good at.

This was an established business in an industry I had nil experience with, and I was expected to make it work.

I inherited the name of the company, its visual identity, the customer base and the products. All the factors that are vital to the success of a business had been predetermined for me.

It had worked for my Dad, but it wasn't working for me.

##Plan B

The challenge of the insurance industry still interested me, but I was targeting the wrong audience (my Dad's business focused on landlords). Knowing this, I settled on staying within insurance but pivoting my audience to freelancers.

This is a group I'm not only in front of, but also a part of. I've worked on the web for years and do freelance photography on the side. I understand and share a lot of the same frustrations.

The quickest way to getting started was to sell another company's product using a third party platform. All _I_ had to do was build a site and market it.

This makes me an affiliate.

It's a simple, efficient and low cost way to getting started, but as I soon found out it isn't without its flaws.

##The Pros

The obvious advantage to being an affiliate is the ability to go from idea to execution quickly.

A lot of the hard work's taken care of, whether that be the creation of a product or establishing a platform to sell it through.

As for being an insurance affiliate, it's both of these things. A product (the policy) and a platform (the quote system) to enable users to quote and buy.

Creating an insurance product and building a platform to distribute it through can take _years_.

I did't have the luxury of time on my side, so I started with a product a third party had created, using their platform to sell it through.

The one thing I do control, and what I spent the majority of my time and money on, was an online presence. A website that embodies the type of insurance company I've always wanted to create (<a href="http://simpleasmilk.com/case-studies/insurance-by-jack/">case study</a>).

No corporate blabber, just insurance on a first-name basis with design at its core.

##The Cons

It may be efficient and low-cost to launch as an affiliate, but there are a lot of cons.

Firstly, I think the term itself has negative connotations. It conjures thoughts of sleazy marketing tactics or low quality products.

The best way to approach being an affiliate is to develop a resource (for example, a blog) that delivers value to people. Through sharing this value you build trust with an audience, making it easier to sell recommended products through your blog.

In other words, being an affiliate works much better when it isn't your primary or sole source of income.

And then there's the lack of control. With everything.

The customer journey, the quote system, any interactions beyond my landing page. The second someone clicks 'Get a quote', they're gone from my watchful eye. I have no idea if I made a sale, or what they thought of the experience.

As I'm not authorised, I'm not allowed access to customer data. Who is buying from me? Am I attracting the market I think I am? Which marketing channel is converting best?

It's impossible to build a business based on blind assumption, yet that's what I'm doing.

There's also a lack of incentive to purchase through my site. Seeing as I'm acting as a third-party, there's no benefit of going through Jack as opposed to direct. I mean, you'd be helping me feed myself and my dog, but who cares about us?

My goal is to build a personable insurer with design at its core, using technology to simplify the process. I can't do that being an affiliate.

The lack of control with customer interaction, design and technology contradicts the business I want to build.

I've portrayed aspects of the brand I want to create through the design, illustrations and words on the site, but that's all they are. Words and pictures on a screen. They don't yet reflect a real company.

So, that's the business I currently have and the business I want to build. I have high regards for the company I'm an affiliate for, but it's very restrictiveâ€”there's no scope to do my own thing.

Do I regret starting as an affiliate as opposed to biding my time and creating my own product and platform? I don't think I do.

I launched Jack with little idea of how to market insurance to freelancers, or what their confusions and pains were surrounding insurance. I've had some enlightening conversations during that time.

This means that when I do come to build the business I want, I've already gotten a lot of mistakes out of the way.
