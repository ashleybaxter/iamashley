<p>It&#8217;s almost a year to the day I made <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/the-transition-from-home-office-to-shared-studio/">the transition from home office to shared studio</a>, after a solitary and monotonous 8 years of working from home. 12 months of renting a desk in a co-working space has since passed, yet I&#8217;ve found myself back at square one—working from my home office.</p>
<p><em>Why?</em></p>

<h3>Cost</h3>
<p>The most obvious factor is cost. I&#8217;ve just launched <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">a new business</a>, it will be a while before I have dispensable income for non-essentials. Going back to my home office has saved me £200 per month, plus the cost of buying coffee and indulging in Marks and Spencer at lunch.</p>
<h3>Exercise and Diet</h3>
<p>What I initially cited as an advantage of working from a studio—the 4 mile round walk—developed into a drawback. Despite the 2 mile commute to and from the studio, this 70 minute walk ate into gym time, meaning I found it difficult including the gym in my daily routine. Working from home, a mere 0.50 miles from my gym, means I can go whenever I like.</p>
<p>Although diet isn&#8217;t as important a factor here—and certainly didn&#8217;t contribute to my decision—I found working in an office to be detrimental to my diet. People would bring in cakes and biscuits to share, almost daily. It turns out that I find it difficult to say no (to food).</p>
<h3>Privacy</h3>
<p>With my recent change in job, I&#8217;ve found the direction of my work has shifted, too. I&#8217;m now doing <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/blog">more writing</a>…and even <a href="http://workingoutpodcast.com">a weekly podcast</a>! Both of these tasks require privacy, or at the very least, quietness. What was once a meeting room available for booking use of is now an office, so there&#8217;s no space to use for tasks requiring peace or privacy.</p>
<h3>Convenience</h3>
<p>It&#8217;s taken me a year of working from a shared studio to appreciate the convenience of working from home. Although I follow a schedule for my work (a recent development after discussing <a href="http://workingoutpodcast.com/2014/05/14/02-time-mismanagement-and-saying-no.html">time management on Working Out</a> podcast), I&#8217;m enjoying the time flexibility and non-existent commute, as well as the reduced expense.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see myself working from my home office for another 8 years, but for the time being I&#8217;m happy to be back. My main concern would be combating cabin fever, but as I have been going through an introverted phase for the past while, I&#8217;m not overly concerned about socialising. If the need does arrive, I&#8217;ll simply take advantage of Glasgow&#8217;s numerous tech and web meet-ups. </p>
