I want to get into the habit of shipping. Having already launched a <a href="http://lodgerapp.co.uk">web app</a>, I know I'm capable of managing my time effectively enough in pursuit of getting my ideas into people's hands, but my web app was plagued with long development cycles and low morale.

Wanting to develop a habit for acting on my ideas, and inspired by <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/makestuff/">Justin Jackson's suggestion</a> to create a small project for every unused domain you own, I suggested to <a href="http://twitter.com/paddydonnelly">Paddy</a>—my Working Out co-host—we do something similar, which resulted in a mini-series for our podcast.

We explore the topics of 'sticking to goals' and 'shipping' on our podcast, <a href="http://workingoutpodcast.com">Working Out</a>—it was time to put our money where our mouth is. Plus, with Paddy's design skills and my… ability to Google stuff about programming, it seemed we could build something decent.

__The criteria:__ It had to encompass both of our skills, tie in with the theme of the podcast, and be designed, built and launched within the four week period of our mini-series.

__The idea:__ <a href="http://takeatoddle.com">Toddle</a>. A daily stand-up app, spurring users to login daily and check off yesterday's goals, add new ones and be provided with an overview of how the user is performing over time.

<h3>What I Learned</h3>

__Setting deadlines is valuable…__ By giving ourselves a sharp date to launch by, the project seemed achievable, always within reach. We agreed to launch forgoing a few features (perhaps even the 'cherry on top'—the overview page), but this enabled us to ship quickly. It would have been easy to continually delay launch until we had a fuller product to show people, but our app was never about that. It was always an experiment, based on sticking to something, shipping and iterating on it.

__…But it's OK to miss them.__ We did actually miss our launch date. Not because of feature creep, but because I suck at coding. I hadn't coded in a long time, and certain things that should have taken little time to complete ended up dragging on. We were a week late with our launch, but the world didn't end.

__Being held accountable for something helps you ship.__ Most of the ideas I have remain private. After all, announcing it publicly but failing to see it through would be embarrassing! Yet that's the whole point—announcing something in public and updating people on your progress is a great incentive to ship. Often, we work on our ideas solo and with little help, meaning morale can take a nosedive. Your Twitter followers or Facebook friends will provide the morale, but they first need to know you're working on something!

__Negative feedback is your friend.__ I've written an entire blog post <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/business-and-marketing/2014/09/30/negative-feedback-is-your-friend.html">on negative feedback</a>, yet I still have trouble leaving myself vulnerable to criticism. As soon as we had a (barely) functioning app, Paddy and I sought feedback from testers. I was embarrassed—the app was even more simple than it is now, and I didn't want people to think we sucked, but the criticism was provided in a constructive, helpful manner and has helped us shape and improve on Toddle. Thank you, testers!

__Setting aside time to maintain skills is important.__ As I already mentioned, I hadn't coded for a while. Even though I really enjoy coding, it's not something I do for <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">my full-time job</a>, therefore it can be difficult to actively set aside time to practice. I regret that. If I had continued to code after shipping my first app, I'd have another 12 months experience under my belt. I'd be a lot further along than I am now. Instead, I felt my progress and everything I'd learned—including the pace at which I code—had been reset.

__The hard work begins when you ship.__ So much of developing a product is about getting to the launch—that's what we focus on and subsequently forget that the launch isn't the end, just the beginning and when the hard work _really_ begins. Since shipping yesterday, we've attracted 177 sign-ups. Now we have to listen to the suggestions these people make and, even though our app is just a bit of fun, commit to making it a better product for everybody.
