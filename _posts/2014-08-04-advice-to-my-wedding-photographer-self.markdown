Slow down, you don't have to rush this. Get it right.

Take your time to compose the best frame. You need to get one _great_ shot, not 20 mediocre ones.

Smileâ€”laugh at the speeches, joke with guests. Nobody wants to hire a miserable photographer.

When possible, try to be invisible.

It's okay to assume control at certain points and tell guests to hold off on taking photos until you're finished. Their harsh flash spilling into your photos is not a good look.

Don't forget why they hired _you_.

Turn up early, stay a little later.

Don't underestimate the importance of this day for those getting married. Yes, you're tired, your feet hurt and a drunken guest was rude to you, but there isn't going to be another day like this for the couple. Give it your all.

Try and tell a story with each picture.

You've seen countless cakes, listened to a wealth of the same gags during speeches, photographed every style of wedding dress. But this is their first (and only).

Don't wear a skirt. On windy days it will blow up and everyone can see your pants. You're not Marilyn Monroe.
