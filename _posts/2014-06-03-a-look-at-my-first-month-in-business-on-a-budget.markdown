<p>A month has passed since launching my new business, <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a>. The last 4 weeks have been a mixture of excitement, apprehension, downheartedness and elation. Sounds about right when running your own business, eh? I&#8217;m finally starting to pick up new customers, and I&#8217;m <em>really</em> pleased with the general traffic the site has been receiving (the traffic I&#8217;ve gotten in my first month of going live is what my last business would get over 4-5 months).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve bootstrapped this business myself, using the money I&#8217;ve made through <a href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk">photography</a> to fund it. There isn&#8217;t a massive budget behind it—especially with marketing—and so I&#8217;ve mostly relied <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/blog">on writing</a> and talking about the business to bring awareness to it.</p>

<p>I thought it would be interesting to put together an overview of the first month&#8217;s traffic sources, as I assume many others are running or starting businesses on small budgets.</p>
<h3>Mmm, Statistics</h3>
<p>Social Media: The majority of traffic—<strong>59%</strong> to be precise—has come from social media, with Twitter responsible for 98% of this traffic, leaving Facebook and Google Plus eating its dust. I haven&#8217;t recorded any visits from LinkedIn.</p>
<p>Direct: <strong>19.9%</strong> of traffic has been direct.</p>
<p>Podcasting: The recent podcast I&#8217;ve been doing with <a href="http://twitter.com/paddydonnelly">Paddy</a>, <a href="http://workingoutpodcast.com">Working Out</a>, coupled with being a guest on <a href="http://unfinished.bz">Unfinished Business</a>, has accounted for <strong>6.7%</strong> of traffic. I know that a listener of Unfinished Business bought a policy with Jack, so it has been an effective means of marketing.</p>
<p>Organic search: My last business was very dependent on Google for traffic and sales. I learned the hard way that this isn&#8217;t a feasible business model, and so I&#8217;m not particularly focused on &#8216;SEO&#8217;. With that said, it would be nice to see the <strong>5.9%</strong> of organic traffic increase over time. Given the site is only a month old and not ranking competitively for any keywords, the bulk of organic traffic has been from people searching directly for us.</p>
<p>Blogging: I&#8217;ve mentioned the business a few times on my blog, and I&#8217;m lucky that a few others have mentioned Jack on their blogs, too. Blogging has accounted for <strong>4.4%</strong> of traffic.</p>
<p>Paid advertising: It&#8217;s interesting that the only area of marketing that&#8217;s cost any money has been the poorest performing. Consumers aren&#8217;t as tolerant of advertising as they once were—you could even say we&#8217;re immune to it, and as a result paid advertising has contributed to only <strong>3%</strong> of traffic. Perhaps the click-through rate isn&#8217;t particularly high, but I at least hope it builds brand awareness.</p>
<h3>Top Performing Posts</h3>
<p>Like I said, as I don&#8217;t have a big marketing budget, I&#8217;ve mostly relied on writing content that (hopefully) attracts traffic. The case studies have been particularly effective, where I visit, interview and photograph small businesses.</p>
