_[UPDATE] Due to me being a n00b with the software I'm using for the drip campaign, the actual figure is 260 subscribers. Not 108. Nice!_

Everybody encourages you to build a mailing list. I haven't. Only because I'm unsure what value I can provide. What's my 'thing'? What can _I_ bring to the table?

In keeping with my budgeted marketing experiments for Insurance by Jack, I decided to create an email course. I wrote about <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/survive-your-first-year-as-a-freelancer/">surviving your first year as a freelancer</a>, calling in favours from freelance friends for quotes, as well as including my own experience as a self-employed photographer.

Expectations weren't high, but I was curious as to what results this would produce.

I hit publish and immediately DM'd my friend, <a href="http://rookieoven.com/">Michael</a>. "_How do I get traffic to this landing page?_". Michael has built an impressive mailing list for his business, Rookie Oven.

Insurance by Jack, on the other hand, doesn't boast the biggest Twitter audience (although to all 150+ of you who do follow, thank you), and I had no idea how to use that modest number to leverage this to its full potential.

Michael suggested I add it to Reddit and Hacker News. The thing is, I think of using these channels solely for the purpose of self promotion as human spam. <a href="http://www.copyblogger.com/shameless-self-promotion/">Self promotion is hard</a>, guys.

Hypocritical, perhaps. After all, I have no beef in using my personal Twitter to pimp my work, but using these channels solely to benefit myself makes me feel uneasy when I previously haven't been a part of their communities. I mean, what if the internet police catch on?

One of my loose 'resolutions' is to be more aggressive in business. Not in a physical manner, obviously, more in a _just bloody do it_ way. So, I submitted it.

I also tweeted the link from the <a href="http://twitter.com/insurancebyjack">Insurance by Jack Twitter</a>. 1 retweet and 4 favourites. 7 other people shared the link independently, which distributed the course to a potential 9,340 people. Don't worry, I know how Twitter works—only a tiny fraction of those people will pay any attention.

Not a bad start.

The email course hovered around the first page of Designer News, which was surprising given there was… <a href="http://www.teehanlax.com/">another piece of internet</a> vying for everyone's attention.

Here's how it fared:

* __Unidentified:__ 649 hits
* __Designer News:__ 437 hits
* __Hacker News:__ 77 hits
* __Sidebar:__ 66 hits
* __Aggregator sites:__ 67 hits

The rest were from Twitter, Facebook etc, and the whole day brought an impressive 1500 people to the landing page, with <s>108</s> 260 of them subscribing and 7 quotes generated as a result.

Moral of the story? As uneasy as self promotion makes me feel, it's imperative to get results. Just bloody do it and do it with conviction. Nike said that, or something similar.

I don't exactly know what I want to gain from this. I guess it was an experiment in driving traffic and increasing awareness of my business. It seems to have worked, and for something I just 'whipped up', it's performed better than many of my other experiments and could potentially be the beginning of building an email list.

Now to figure out how to make _that_ work for me…
