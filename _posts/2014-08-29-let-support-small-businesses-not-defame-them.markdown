Twitter has become a tool primarily used for disgruntled customers, it seems. A day rarely passes without the platform being used to vent frustrations aimed at businesses. _"Hey, @company, your app's downtime is screwing up my life!"_. Or, _".@company, your site is broken and there's a typo. Gosh, you suck"_.

I used to do this, too. <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Then I started my own business</a> and realised how hard it is to always get things right.

Sure, a public outcry can be an effective way of nudging a business—especially a big corporation—to respond and deal with your issue, but a negative outcry towards a _small_ business could be dangerously damaging.

Most of the people I see airing their (at times unnecessarily harsh) disappointment are small business owners themselves.

Us small businesses should be _supporting_ one another, not defaming one another.

Real people are behind these companies. Just like you and me, they've dreamt up an idea in the shower or while out for a jog. Just like you and me, they have goals and aspirations. Just like you and me, they're working very hard towards building something they're proud of. But, just like you and me, they're human and prone to making mistakes.

Sometimes websites break, typos happen, or apps experience downtime.

Downright sloppy service can't be excused, of course, but those real people running businesses _can_—and will—make mistakes. Just like you and me.

The next time a product or service disappoints you, have the respect to contact a business _privately_. Believe it or not, your followers don't particularly care that you're experiencing broadband issues, and contacting the business privately gives them a chance to rectify their error and save face without their reputation being tarnished.

After all, they're just like you and me, and wouldn't you prefer a bit of leniency when you slip up? I know I would.
