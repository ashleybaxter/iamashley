Tomorrow I head to London for what I'm considering to be my last shot at this whole 'simplifying technology in the insurance industry' ambition.

It's been my goal for a few years, but it's never progressed with ease. It's been a process of one step forward and two steps back, quickly followed by a period of stagnation.

This pattern has repeated itself for two-three years. Two-three years of disappointment and set-backs, only interspersed with the occasional triumph.

The strange thing is, the bumpy nature of this journey hasn't weakened my desire to fulfil this goal. I still feel just as strongly (and capable) of achieving it. I don't _want_ to give up, but after many dead ends I am approaching tomorrow as my last chance.

<h2>Better Standards</h2>

I truly believe the UK insurance industry is in need of a make-over. Consumers _expect_ to feel frustrated with insurance, whether it’s not understanding the jargon or struggling with the archaic technology.

It doesn't have to be that way. It shouldn't be that way. A new insurer has to come along who sets better standards. I wanted that to be me.

While most insurers are competing on price, I want to build a better insurance company from a design and technology standpoint. I want to provide people with a pleasant customer journey—from initial quote to payment and any correspondence in-between.

I have been talking about this for years. Tomorrow is my last chance to not just talk the talk, but to walk the walk.
