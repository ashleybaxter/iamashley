Glasgow has always lacked a central location for tech people to gather, to work, to hack. It seems to be something every other city has—even our neighbour, Edinburgh.

Last year, I started thinking about how I'd love to create that space.

Around the time I was having these thoughts, Michael happened to write <a href="http://rookieoven.com/2014/06/18/where-is-the-heart-of-the-glasgow-tech-community/#top">a blog post</a> on the exact same thing. Where is the heart of the Glasgow tech community?

I'd never spoken to Michael before, but I had to let him know I 100% agreed with him and would do what I could to make it happen. As it turned out, I wasn't the only person to respond favourably to Michael's blog post. This was the validation we needed to create the space.

That space is less than a week from becoming a reality.

<h2>Our New Office: A Renovated Shipyard</h2>

I can't take any credit for getting to this point. Michael—although he'll likely disagree due to modesty—did _all_ of the hard work. He was back and forth between a few potential spaces in Glasgow (I'm so glad we ended up with this space), negotiating, crunching numbers. It was a lengthy, and sometimes frustrating, process.

Over 10 of us will be moving into this space on Monday, but we do intend on growing the community. If you're working on a tech business in Glasgow, why not <a href="mailto:hello@iamashley.co.uk">join us</a>? 

Did I mention it's a renovated shipyard? It's a renovated shipyard! For anyone who is interested in reading about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairfield_Shipbuilding_and_Engineering_Company">the history</a>, that's what Wikipedia is for, right?

Here's what I plan on doing in the space:

* Daily <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a> work. Most of my 9-5 workload is spent on Insurance by Jack. I'll be using this space Monday-Friday to do all of my usual work.
* <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/ask">Ask Jack</a> videos. I'm starting a new Q+A series called Ask Jack, where I respond to a business insurance question every week with a video. The new open-plan space is perfect for recording these videos.
* <a href="http://glasgowphotowalk.co.uk">Glasgow Photo Walk</a> workshops. Now I have space to work from again, I'll be using it to teach my own photography workshops, as well as invite other photographers into Glasgow to host their own.
* Studio photography. I'm not huge into studio photography, but I'd like to subsidise my rent by using the space for a bit of photography work. Also, since seeing <a href="http://www.hollybooth.com/portfolio/">Holly's product photography</a>, I want to try product photography and now have a space to use creatively.
* Business events. We're keeping part of the space dedicated to hosting events, mini-conferences and meet-ups.
* Building products. There are many smart people in this building, perhaps they can help me up my coding game? Or maybe there's collaboration opportunity somewhere. Either way, I expect to be fully inspired working from here.

Here are the businesses the space is opening with:

* <a href="http://addjam.com/">Add Jam</a>
* <a href="https://farmer.io/">FarmGeek</a>
* <a href="http://rawtech.io/">Raw Tech</a>
* <a href="http://www.lighthouselabs.co.uk/">Lighthouse Labs</a>
* <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a>
* You?
