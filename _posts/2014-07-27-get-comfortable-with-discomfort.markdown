It's not easy to force yourself to endure the unwelcome butterflies, sweaty palms and aggressively beating heart (that's my symptoms of nervousness, at least), which is why most people don't put themselves through it. They say <strong>YES</strong> to feeling comfortable, but subsequently say <strong>NO</strong> to growth, opportunity and confidence. That is why I try to edge myself past the comfort zone—because I want to experience growth, opportunity and confidence.

What makes me uncomfortable? Public speaking is the biggest culprit. It used to be flying (which derives from my bigger fear of motion), but I've forced myself to fly so regularly it isn't nearly as terrifying as it once was, although a pre-flight gin is always recommended.

Last week, as <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk/news/2014/07/24/practical-takeaways.html">I gave my talk in Cardiff</a>, Wales at <a href="http://practicaltakeaways.co.uk">Practical Takeaways</a>, I was—as I always do when public speaking—thinking, "I'm not enjoying this. This will be my last talk". You see, I dislike everything about public speaking. The sleepless nights in the build up, the anxiety surrounding preparing material that will be considered of value, and the nerve wracking delivery itself.

After my talk at Practical Takeaways was over, I flew home to Glasgow and breathed a sigh of relief. I always do after a talk, enjoying the temporary high of no longer having to contend with a temperamental nervous system… until the <em>next</em> scary opportunity, which—this time—just happened to be as I arrived home.

I received an email from a TV researcher for a daily magazine programme. "Can you join us on live TV tonight? It will go out to 2 million people". <a href="http://twitter.com/hellorogue">A friend</a> who works in TV had recommended me. My stomach flipped violently. My heart was sitting uncomfortably in my mouth. This meant I had to say yes, as much as my body was screaming <em>oh, hell no</em>.

Similar to my public speaking episodes, I disliked every second of it as it was happening. The final countdown until we went live, in particular, caused me to think I was going to empty the contents of my stomach onto the floor. That would have been fun on live TV. <em>"This is it. No going back"</em>, I thought to myself as the countdown closed in on 3-2-1….

Whatever nerves I've experienced on stage at a conference—and even facing my fear of flying—were multiplied with this experience. Likely because it was new and unknown. And because my mum and gran were watching. It caused me so much discomfort, in fact, I've unmercifully agreed on another two appearances, <a href="https://twitter.com/danrubin/status/492720040324898816">one of which was Friday</a> just passed. The nerves were still there, but not as cripplingly as it was in comparison to my first experience.

Why do things that terrify you? Whether it be flying, public speaking or appearing on live TV, I think good opportunities can come from edging out of your comfort zone (opportunity, growth, confidence). And the more I do things that scare me, the more accustomed to dealing with the symptoms of fear I'll become. I like the idea of that.

<strong>I'm not perfect</strong>. Sometimes, I still say no. I hate myself when I do. Ultimately, I ask myself what type of person I want to be. Is it the person whose weeks, months and years pass comfortably? Who is getting by, but who'll more or less be in the same place 20 years from now that they're currently in? Or is it the person who proactively seeks new challenges and consistently pushes their boundaries? They choose experiences that frighten them, which—in the short-term can often feel self-harming (<em>why am I putting myself through this?</em>)—but in the long-term it leads to opportunity. There is no right or wrong answer, but I know which person I want to become.

The only sense of comfort I want to feel is with discomfort.
