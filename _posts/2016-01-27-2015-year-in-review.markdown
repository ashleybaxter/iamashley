I felt 2015 was a quiet year, failing to nudge myself out of my comfort zone enough. This is how I gauge if I'm doing things right. Does it challenge me? Good, do it.

2015 was a different pace. It was about shifting direction and making difficult decisions. I didn't know it at the time, but all this was in preparation for a more focused 2016.

With that said, I looked back over the year and realised a lot did happen. The past 12 months are something I _can_ be proud of.

<h2>New Beginnings</h2>

I kicked the year off by moving into my dream office, <a href="http://rookieoven.com/coworking/">RookieOven</a>. It's a converted shipyard with a focus on people working in tech.

We even landed a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/7VImbMm3Q_/?taken-by=insurancebyjack">feature in Net Mag</a>.

Of course, the other new beginning far outshone this. In May we welcomed my nephew, Blake, into the world.

He has been the highlight of 2015.

<h2>Endings</h2>

A lot of good things came to an end.

After 10 months, the TV show I was on cut my segment. Every two weeks I'd do the newspaper review _live_ on the telly box.

<a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/fof7bolbq2zoyiv/10825583_588586207954849_915688123_n.mp4?dl=0"><img src="/img/blog/newspaperreview.jpg" alt="The Riverside Show"></a>

It's an experience I'll never forget, teaching me how to better handle my nerves. Have _you_ ever tried not to barf on live TV?

I also winded down all my side projects. Glasgow Photo Walk, Working Out Show, as well as cut loose a _ton_ of domains. This was because I decided to <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/business/2015/12/07/focus/">focus on insurance</a>.

I wrote about <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/business/2015/12/07/focus/">_why_</a>, but the gist was: I got burnt out and decided to drop a lot of unnecessary distractions.

<h2>Revenue</h2>

When I reviewed the goals I'd set myself for 2015, a lot of them were revenue related.

That definitely changed as the year progressed. Money isn't as big a priority anymore. I ended up turning down a lot of paying work due to my decision to focus on insurance.

One target I did hit was with the launch of my email course in May (£2.2K in revenue for the month I ran it).

I then sold it to <a href="https://exposure.co">Exposure</a>. I'm a big fan of Exposure, so I think that's my work achievement of the year. I'm confident they'll do something cool with it.

<h2>Health and Fitness</h2>

I used to be obsessed with exercise to the point I'd hate taking rest days. I still work out regularly, just not to the extent I did a few years ago.

I'm a little chubbier for it, which I'm not thrilled about, so I resolved to run another 10K.

It's the second one I've completed. I'm definitely not as fit as I used to be, completing it in 61 minutes. For 2016 races will become a recurring theme.

Now, if only I can improve my diet…

<h2>Travel</h2>

Traveling compliments my photography hobby, but adventures were seriously limited in 2015.

I started the year strong with a visit to <a href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk/isle-of-skye/">Isle of Skye</a> for my birthday in January, then treated my mum to a long weekend in <a href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk/family-trip-to-paris/">Paris</a> in February.

That was it for the year. Lame.

I have two destinations lined up for Q1 of 2016: Copenhagen and New York.

A few other notable things worth mentioning:

* I had my photos printed in my favourite publication, <a href="http://www.readlagom.com/">Lagom</a>

* <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ashleybaxter/">Instagram</a> made me a suggested user for the second time

* Digital World created a video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMSn6FgwfkY">case study</a> about my career in insurance

<h2>This Year</h2>

I'm keeping things simple. I'll work on improving my diet. I'll say _'Yes'_ to things that scare me, _if_ they're relevant to my goal. Most importantly, I'll make progress with building my insurance business (and blogging about the journey).

I'm confident that—with last year's effort I put into phasing out distractions—I'll have a more focused and productive 2016.
