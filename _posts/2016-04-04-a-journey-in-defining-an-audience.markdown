Want to sabotage your business in one simple step? Fail to define an audience.

Talk about an obvious mistake to avoid, yet it was one I made with <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">Insurance by Jack</a>. Nervous of losing potential sales by excluding people, I launched with too broad an audience.

I aimed my business at "anyone who works on the web".

* Startups
* Creative agencies
* Freelancers
* And more…

__Spoiler:__ If your audience has the word "anyone" in it, it needs refined.

Businesses perform _better_ when positioned to a particular group of people. This is especially true in saturated markets like insurance, where I’m competing against bigger, more established insurers.

Being clear on who your audience is gives your business clarity, which permeates through your design, copy and marketing strategy. It helps you project a message consistent with your audience, therefore attracting (the right) customers.

The following websites do this particuarly well:

* <a href="http://justtelljulie.com/">Just Tell Julie</a>, an overdue invoice service _for freelancers_
* <a href="http://convertkit.com/">ConvertKit</a>, email marketing _for professional bloggers_
* <a href="https://www.hellobonsai.com/">Bonsai</a>, bulletproof contracts _for freelancers_

By not wanting to exclude people and having too general an audience, I wasn't really targeting anybody. In fact, I don't think at any point did my website explicitly state who I was selling to.

_Doh._

Addressing this has been my primary concern with the next iteration of Jack. Research lead me to abandon startups and agencies, and focus exclusively on freelancers. Specifically, freelance designers and developers.

Research? Yeah, research! Something I should have done from the beginning. The decision to target freelancers wasn't a blind assumption (I've made too many of those).

I'd integrated my quote form with Campaign Monitor to capture email addresses. This was never used for unsolicited email, but instead to help me build a complete profile of the type of customer I was attracting. 

Analysing this data showed I was predominantly attracting freelance designers and developers. From there, I was able identify the problems this group have in regards to insurance, the language they use when talking about it, and the questions they ask.

_Now_ we're getting somewhere.

<strong>Problem:</strong> Freelancers know they _should_ have business insurance, but don’t quite understand why.

<strong>Solution:</strong> Educate freelancers on the benefits of having business insurance, offer a policy specifically tailored to them, and make it simple to buy.

<strong>Elevator pitch:</strong> Insurance by Jack is for professional freelancers serious about building a bulletproof business.

Having this clarity helps me shape the product, the platforms I use to reach my audience, and even influences the way I'll communicate with them.

To reflect this change, I've worked with a copywriter on revising the website's copy with this audience in mind. Same tone, same ethos—it's just clearer who my target customer is.

I’m also infuencing the creation of a professional indemnity policy exclusively for my target audience. This isn’t a 'one-size-fits-all' insurance policy for general business—this is designed for freelancers.

In WP Curve's brilliant teardown (<a href="http://wpcurve.com/convertkit/">Part 1</a>, <a href="http://wpcurve.com/convertkit-2/">Part 2</a>) of how Nathan Barry grew ConvertKit, Nathan acknowledges the flaw in his early marketing. He'd never really answered who ConvertKit was for, much like I failed to do with Insurance by Jack.

<blockquote>When your target market is too wide, it’s hard to make a compelling case as to why anyone should use your product, and consequently, no one is really excited about it. Remember, customers don’t want products that are made for <em>everyone</em>, they want products that are made for <em>them</em>.</blockquote>

I've wasted time and money on disjointed marketing due to not being clear who my audience was.

* I've sponsored conferences my target customer wasn't even attending
* My content marketing has been scattered
* I've paid for ads in the wrong places

These were expensive mistakes I could have avoided had I taken the time to __clearly__ define my audience.

Advice from Captain Obvious?

1. Invest a generous portion of time into defining your audience. I had data to dig into to paint a picture of who I was reaching, but you can be smart and decide on your positioning from the outset. Failing to do this is a costly mistake.

2. Don't fall into the trap of targeting too broad an audience. Drop the "anyone who…" and "everyone that…". The more specific you can be, the better your marketing, message and business will be.
