<p>A year ago, I built a <a href="http://landlord-insurance.herokuapp.com/" title="Quote System Prototype">prototype of a quote system</a> and demoed it to an insurer in London. Without getting into the nitty gritty, I am an appointed representative for the insurer and they provide me with a third-party quote system. The gist was &#8220;Guys, I&#8217;m unhappy with the way we&#8217;re quoting on the web. I want to implement <a href="http://landlord-insurance.herokuapp.com/" title="Quote System Protoype">this system</a> I built on <a href="http://brokersdirect.co.uk" title="Brokers Direct">my own website</a>&#8220;. Despite an initially favourable response, I was ultimately told it was too complicated. Boo.</p>

<p>There are many things I dislike about myself; my irrational temper and stocky thighs to name a couple, but the one thing I <em>do</em> like, if I am allowed to say so, is that I can&#8217;t be told something isn&#8217;t possible. I simply think about ways to work around it, refusing to adopt a defeatist attitude.</p>
<p>With that said, another year of using the third-party quote system passed. In my defence, I was busy with <a href="http://lodgerapp.co.uk" title="Lodger">another project</a>, but the quote system was always lodged at the back of my mind. I knew I had to look at an alternative way of quoting, even if it meant stripping the whole process back.</p>
<p>And this is where, well, <em>this</em> comes in.</p>
<div id="attachment_277" style="width: 650px" class="wp-caption aligncenter"><a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/easylet.app-640x480.png" rel="fancybox[276]"><img src="http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/easylet.app-640x480.png" alt="EasyLet Teaser" width="640" height="480" class="size-full wp-image-277" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text">EasyLet Teaser. It&#8217;s time I took control over the quoting process, even if it means stripping things back.</p></div>
<p>In this day and age, consumers are accustomed to quoting <em>and</em> purchasing insurance online. Sadly, in the process of stripping back and terminating the third-party software, I&#8217;ve had to eliminate the option to purchase online. It was a safer option, therefore, to use a subdivision of my company as an experiment, a site that doesn&#8217;t generate as much traffic.</p>
<p>I built the site in Rails, meaning <em>I</em> retain all customer data as opposed to it feeding direct to my agent. Instead of dipping into a database of, say, seven different insurers, which means seven different rates and seven different variables (one insurer will consider postcode G3, for example, a flood zone while another won&#8217;t), I am using one product. One product with one rate. This means I can calculate an accurate quote for my potential customer, whilst retaining complete control over the whole process – <em>aside</em> from purchasing.</p>
<p>Upon a user receiving their quote, they are offered a breakdown of cover in a digestible, at-a-glance format, and decide whether the cover suits their needs. If it does, they have the freephone number they can call, or the option to request a callback from us. Simple.</p>
<p>Sure, it does feel I am taking two steps back in regards to removing the ability to purchase insurance online, but – as my messy motto goes – &#8220;let&#8217;s just do this and see what happens&#8221;.</p>
<p>I am launching this website within the next few weeks and will be blogging about it – amongst other techy /  insurance things – on my <a href="http://brokersdirect.co.uk/blog" title="Brokers Direct Blog">company website</a>.
