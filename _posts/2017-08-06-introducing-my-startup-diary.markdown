Vlogging has been on my mind for a while. I had a YouTube channel in a past life when I was a gamer. I stopped because I fell away from gaming—and because the YouTube community hated me (but that's what happens when you're a female gamer).

I already had the kit I needed to get started with Vlogging because <a href="https://girlwithacamera.co.uk">I do photography</a>. A camera that shoots video, lenses, a tripod… Let's go!

I wanted to record a diary of sorts. A behind the scenes of building With Jack. Real, honest insights—even on days when things aren't going well. Building a business isn't always dollar bills falling from the sky, you know.

I've been enjoying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/techomic">Justin Jackson</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/crxnamja">Noah Kagan's</a> YouTube channel. They focus on business and building products, and Justin films the occasional vlog.

I thought I could offer a different persepctive as a solo, female founder bootstrapping a business in Scotland. Not only that, but the UK insurance industry isn't very transparent. Nobody is really sharing the process of building an insurance business, warts and all.

My <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJdtciVNCxmhQnn2cnWK6qg">Startup Diary</a> is now on YouTube and updated weekly. If you like it, please become a subscriber!
