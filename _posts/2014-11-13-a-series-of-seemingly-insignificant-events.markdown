It fascinates me that a series of seemingly insignificant events can potentially be tiny dots connecting to something much bigger—something which can change the course of your life, or simply provide you with options that weren't previously available to you.

That's what has been on my mind lately, and here's why…

In 2013, Simon Collison hosts the final New Adventures in Web Design conference in Nottingham.

I attend.

While in Nottingham, I go on a photo walk around the city with other New Adventures attendees, which is where I first spot Craig Lockwood.

A few weeks later, I receive an email from Craig asking if I can photograph his conference, Handheld, in Wales.

I say yes.

While in Wales, I get a bit of work done in Founders Hub, the local co-working spot.

6 months later, Craig invites me back to Wales, this time to _speak_ at a conference on bringing creativity into a non-creative industry.

I say yes.

I return to Founders Hub once more, where I'm introduced to Jaymie Thomas. Jaymie is MD of Red Apple Software, building products for insurance companies.

I tell Jaymie of my desire to improve the insurance quoting and buying experience, building a company with good design and technology at the core.

Jaymie knows a guy he thinks can help me and, via email, introduces me to Mick Cairns.

A month later, I'm sitting in a hotel in Preston with Mick and Jaymie. We talk insurance, technology and ideas.

Another few months pass before I meet Mick again, this time in Glasgow where we further flesh things out.

I seek a team of talented designers to begin redesigning the quoting and buying process online.

Although it's difficult to foresee how this will all pan out, this _could_ be a step towards accomplishing my goal—a goal I have been striving towards for a long time, all because of events that bear no connection to my goal; a conference I attended, people I've met, experiences I've said 'yes' to.

I love the unpredictability of it all. I guess I just wanted to emphasise that you should say 'yes' to things. Put yourself out there. Just _go_ with it. You put a lot in, you get a lot out. Aye.
