Last week the <a href="https://www.digitalworld.net/">Digital World</a> roadshow arrived in Edinburgh. Alongside two of Scotland's billion-dollar tech companies (that's a whole other post about <a href="https://twitter.com/iamashley/status/722014688180051968">imposter syndrome</a>), I joined the panel to discuss careers in tech.

My background in tech is unusual. I was studying music at college when my dad passed away. The next day, I was in his office having inherited <a href="https://brokersdirect.co.uk">the family business</a>. It was worth £1.2 million. I was 18 years old.

I had to learn on the job—_and quickly_.

With it being a small business, I learned a bit of everything. Front-end / back-end development, marketing, <a href="/business/2016/04/13/using-third-party-platforms-to-build-a-business/">SEO</a> etc. Just enough to get by. I'm a generalist.

I touched upon my background during the panel, but I didn't go into depth for fear of getting too personal.

My set of circumstances was unique, but anybody can create their own path. It's 2016—there is no set route into tech! You can bypass university and traditional employment, _if_ that's what you want.

Curious about a topic? Follow your nose and learn about it. Commitment and consistency go a long way where self-education is concerned. Apply what you're learning to a side project or portfolio and, hey presto, you're a candidate for a career in tech.

I talk about my path in tech, yet I work in a non-technical business. Insurance. Landing in a role in 2005 that didn't gel with my personality or interests, I created my own version of the job. I inherited my Dad's business, yet I don't approach or run it like he did.

I'm building <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">an insurance company</a> with design and technology—two of my interests—at its core. This means I'm;

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>a) enjoying the work I do,</li>
<li>b) building the kind of company I want,</li>
<li>c) not experiencing 'Sunday dread', because I actually like my career</li>
</ul>

In this era, it's possible to _create_ a career unique to your strengths and interests.

In terms of transitioning from student to traditional employment, there wasn't anything I could contribute to the panel, but I had an alternative message to deliver. With 7 of us discussing the options with a limited timeframe of 20 minutes—and my lack of confidence with public speaking—I felt my message was lost.

Fortunately, <a href="http://www.jamesaltucher.com/">James Altucher</a> sums up my thoughts perfectly.

<blockquote>You do not have to wait any longer for the gods of corporate America, or universities, or investors, to come down from the clouds and choose you for success.</blockquote>

We're now in an era where you can build your own platform, be your own boss and define success by your own terms.

_That's_ the message I'd hoped to emphasise on the panel.
