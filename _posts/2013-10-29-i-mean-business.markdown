<p>Most people are feeling the pinch. Times are tough, and in every industry companies are working twice as hard to generate half as much money. At least that&#8217;s how it feels to me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed a definite shift in the insurance industry – which I work in – over the past decade, watching the landscape grow more competitively. Comparison websites are dominating the media, and major supermarkets, who have the budget and ability to reach more people, are now offering an extensive range of insurance products. How am I meant to compete with this?</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be lying if I said I&#8217;ve figured this out, but with an interest in the web I have looked for my answer in technology (which it seems few other insurance companies are doing). Hence the birth of <a href="http://brokersdirect.co.uk/software/" title="Lodger">Lodger</a>, and a seemingly insurmountable fight to deploy a quote system I had prototyped earlier in the year (apparently there are complexities with implementing my own quote system, which is why – for now – I&#8217;m still using a third party option).</p>
<p>I must ask myself, what else can I build that will satisfy my customers / win new clients? A couple of thoughts that have come into my head, or been planted by people far smarter than me (I&#8217;m not smart):</p>
<ul>
<li>A claims handling app to simplify the claiming process</li>
<li>An insurance dashboard</li>
<li>Inventory tracking app for contents insurance</li>
<li>Renewal reminder (with incentive)</li>
</ul>
<p>Giant chains have many advantages over a small business like my own – mainly in terms of budget and reach – but it&#8217;s an empowering thought to know I can come up with an idea and bring it to fruition fairly quickly. I may not have a large team behind me, but I&#8217;m also without the (many) rungs on a corporate ladder overlooking every factor, and therefore slowing the process down. This is what gives <em>me</em> an advantage. This is why small is beautiful.</p>
