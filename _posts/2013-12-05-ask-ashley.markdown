<p>Every time I&#8217;ve taken to something new, whether it be photography or &#8211; more recently â€“ programming, I&#8217;ve been humbled by the help, advice and encouragement I&#8217;ve received from those smarter than myself. I&#8217;m eternally grateful for the fact someone is willing to selflessly give me their time or expertise and expect nothing in return.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I&#8217;ll receive the odd email or Tweet from a photographer looking for tips on post-processing, lens flare or software. I&#8217;d like to make myself more approachable, more available, and help those that think I may have an answer to their query.</p>

<p>So, I built <a href="http://ask-ashley.herokuapp.com" title="Ask Ashley">Ask Ashley</a>. It&#8217;s nothing fancy. You can submit a private question that sends directly to my inbox. I reply with a (hopefully) helpful solution. You get an answer to your photography-related question from a real human. Me. That&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>Although I built it to &#8216;give something back&#8217; (I can&#8217;t type that without sounding lame), it&#8217;s a selfish solution to make myself feel better. To feel worthy after receiving help, an education, or simple nudging in the right direction from some very fine folk (too many to name).</p>
<p>Truthfully, I think too many people are afraid of asking questions in fear of looking stupid. I&#8217;m not one of those people. When I need help, I ask. If I&#8217;m stuck, I call a favour. <a href="http://ask-ashley.herokuapp.com" title="Ask Ashley">Ask Ashley</a> is my way of saying &#8220;Hey, it&#8217;s okay to ask <em>me</em> for help, or my opinion, or how I do things&#8221;.</p>
<p>So, <a href="http://ask-ashley.herokuapp.com" title="Ask Ashley">Ask Ashley</a>. And yes, I&#8217;m <em>still</em> doing the face in a circle thing.</p>
<p>On a side note, the total time from idea to execution was under 2 hours. This took me no time to do. It&#8217;s messy like everything in my life, but hopefully one person finds value in it.</p>
