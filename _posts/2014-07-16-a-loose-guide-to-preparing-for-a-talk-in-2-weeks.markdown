I've never had a limited, nail-biting timeframe of just 2 weeks to research, write and prepare for <a href="http://practicaltakeaways.co.uk">a conference talk</a>. As somebody who hates public speaking, this is a sure-fire way to provoke feelings of <strong>stress</strong> and <strong>anxiety</strong>. Not only was this the least amount of time I've had to prep for a talk, it was (prior to the traffic issue on the day that caused many to turn back in frustration, leaving the venue half full) the biggest crowd I'd be speaking to. Petrifying. Yet I did manage to pull it off without fluffing my talk.

Here is a loose guide to preparing for your talk in such a limited timeframe.

<h3>Manage Your Time Effectively</h3>

Time management has to come into play here. It sounds obvious, but I bet I'm not the only person who is a stickler for saying, "I'll start work on this tomorrow". That attitude won't cut it here.

With such a short time scale to get everything done, I managed my time by limiting myself to just 7 days to research, structure and write the talk, and the final 7 days to familiarise myself with the content and rehearse my talk (not all speakers rehearse, but I feel more confident on stage if I'm familiar with the content of my talk). Break your talk down into chunks, and schedule days to tackle the chunks; <strong>plan, structure, research, rehearse</strong> (or whatever order you're comfortable with).

Obviously, I couldn't commit an <em>entire</em> day to working on my talk, and it's likely you can't either—I had to fit it in around a busy social period and regular work commitments, too. It helped to have an overview of my calendar and assign specific tasks to days, and even hours, when I had a slot of free time. For example:

<ul>
<li><strong>Monday, 6:00PM onwards:</strong> Write down any and all ideas for my talk. Use this as a brain dump period and getting everything down onto paper, as incoherent as it is.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday, 6.30PM-9:00PM:</strong> Group my brain dump into chapters (I think of my talk in chapters), which will form the structure of the talk.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday, 5:00PM-6.30PM:</strong> Research businesses in non-creative industries, and businesses doing something different with technology in a traditional field.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday, 8:00AM-10.00AM:</strong> Flesh out the first two chapters.</li>
</ul>

And so on… Normally, I'm not so organised, but this helped me hit my deadline.

<h3>Re-use Material</h3>

Instead of designing a deck of new slides, I used the same theme from <a href="http://dotyork.com">my last talk</a> and even regurgitated a lot of the slides. I felt a bit uneasy doing this—after all, working on the visual aspect of the talk can often be the most fun!

With such a limited timeframe, though, you <em>are</em> going to have to cut corners, and a fancy design doesn't deliver as much value as the content. It's 100% acceptable to re-use material from past talks—most speakers do this.

<h3>Accept It's Not Going To Be Perfect</h3>

This is perhaps the most important point to remember. The sooner you come to peace with accepting it's not going to be perfect, the better (but don't misunderstand this for sacrificing quality). There were a million other examples I wanted to include in my talk, slides I wanted to tweak, points I wanted to refine. But I couldn't—I just didn't have the time to do so.

I think it's quite common to feel that if you're not improving at something, then it's a failure. This talk may have not been 'polished' or felt 'done', but that doesn't mean I failed. In fact, I feel a sense of achievement and confidence that I was able to plan, write and deliver a talk within such a confined timescale. So there is that. More importantly, the audience had plenty of <a href="https://storify.com/insurancebyjack/practical-takeaways/">kind words to say</a> and obviously took some value away from it.

<h3>Lastly, Look On The Bright Side</h3>

There <em>is</em> a bright side. Yes, it's stressful having such a limited amount of time to prepare for a talk, but it means you don't have the weeks and months of sleepless nights in the build-up.

Because you're so engrossed in working on your talk, the usual anxiety surrounding a talk (whether it's going to be well received, or if you'll forget what you're meant to be saying. Well, those are my anxieties) doesn't have a chance to manifest during the very short build-up. Phew.

So, next time you're approached to write a new talk on a subject within a limited window of time, don't immediately write it off. With a bit of preparation, planning and shamelessly digging into a bank of existing material, you can pull it off.
