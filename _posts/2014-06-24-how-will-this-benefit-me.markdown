"How will this benefit me?" When presented with a work-related opportunity, this is the question I ask myself.

For example, when offered a speaking gig, my initial reaction has been, "I'm getting paid to promote my business. Perfect". This is a destructive and selfish angle, albeit fairly justified—after all, my primary objective <em>is</em> to build <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk">my business</a>, and I don't think anybody can assassinate me for that. However, a richer perspective would be, "Who is the audience, and how can I help them accomplish <em>their</em> goals?".

I've been asking myself the wrong question, something I've only realised through participating in a community for freelancers and entrepreneurs. Somebody had asked if they should accept an opportunity to guest blog. My response was centred solely around what _I_ had reaped from my guest blogging experience, which was a paid speaking gig and another offer to write for a respectable publication. After reading the replies—which were focused on the audience and whether this person could provide <em>value</em> to them—I felt selfish and hedonistic. This was further emphasised with another, similar example, ultimately leading to my realisation I have been asking the wrong question.

<h3>Long-Term Success vs Short-Term Gains</h3>

If I intend on doing more public speaking (which I do. I think. I don't know, <a href="http://iamashley.co.uk/blog/i-launched-my-business-on-stage-to-200-people-but-that-was-the-easy-part/">I still hate it</a>) and writing, promoting my personal agenda will only reap short-term gains—a temporary increase in traffic, momentary brand awareness. Providing genuine worth will, I believe, result in long-term success. This approach of providing value will lead to producing better, more relevant content, and if the audience get value from it, so will I. Win-win.

Don't get me wrong, asking if an opportunity will benefit you isn't a redundant question. After all, time is valuable and you have to choose where you spend that time (and on what) wisely. But I do believe that approaching each opportunity with selfish intent isn't setting anyone up for long-term success, just short-term gains. How will your work improve if you stop considering the solo benefits, and begin to question how it will provide value to <em>others</em>?

The question I will now ask myself is, "What value can I provide to others by doing this?". I like the sound–and potential implications—of that a whole lot better.
