			<p>Are you building a business in a crowded market? Me, too! My competitors are dropping millions of pounds a month on marketing. With my budget, I can't compete with that. So, what do I do? I'm going to be sharing what methods I try and how they've fared through my newsletter, hoping to prove you don't need a monstrous marketing budget to make the monies.</p>
