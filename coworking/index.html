<h4>Co-Working Space in Glasgow</h4>
<p>In February of 2015, myself and several other local startups moved into Glasgow's newest co-working space, <a href="http://rookieoven.com/coworking/">RookieOven</a>.</p>

<p>Glasgow has a <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-24820573">history steeped in shipbuilding</a>. At one point, the city was world-famous not for its battered Mars Bar but the shipbuilding industry. While that has long since declined, the famous Fairfield shipyard has been renovated into offices, which we now call home.</p>

<p>What was once the drawing office where shipping blueprints were devised is now where developers and designers collaborate to bring ideas to life.</p>

<p>If you're a local tech company looking for a space with the 'wow' factor, come and <a href="mailto:hello@iamashley.co.uk">have a look around</a>. The Â£175+VAT p/m includes a custom-made desk, pool table, coffee machine, fibre broadband, free on-site parking, and a boat that will ferry you or your clients across the Clyde at no extra charge.</p>

<p>Unit 8, Fairfield, 1048 Govan Road, G51 4XS.</p>
