			<p>Hey, I'm Ashley. I'm an unusual hybrid of photographer and insurer, with a smattering of programming on the side. I run <a href="http://insurancebyjack.co.uk" title="Insurance by Jack">Insurance by Jack</a>, tailoring business insurance to creative professionals. Come the summer months, I can be found <a href="http://girlwithacamera.co.uk" title="Girl With A Camera">photographing</a> a limited number of weddings. I also record a <a href="http://workingoutpodcast.com" title="Working Out Podcast">weekly podcast</a> where—alongside my co-host—we discuss our journeys in creating our passion-based businesses. I like video games, the gym, and my dog. I tweet at <a href="http://twitter.com/iamashley" title="Ashley on Twitter">@iamashley</a>.</p>
